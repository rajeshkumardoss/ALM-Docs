Hereâ€™s a breakdown of different approaches:

ðŸ”¹ 1 Solution, Multiple Dev Environments
 Pros: High scalability, flexible deployment.
 Cons: Requires professional development skills.
 Risk: ðŸ’µ Low
 Speed: ðŸŸ¡ Medium

ðŸ”¹ Split Solutions by Department
 Pros: Low-code friendly, tailored for department needs.
 Cons: Highest risk of dependencies
 Risk: ðŸ”´ High
 Speed: ðŸŸ¢ Fast

ðŸ”¹ 1 Solution with Shared Components, Rest Split by Department
 Pros: Combines scalability with low-code flexibility.
 Cons: Medium complexity and coordination needed.
 Risk: ðŸŸ¡ Medium
 Speed: ðŸŸ¡ Medium

ðŸ”¹ 1 Solution, 1 Environment
 Pros: Simple and cohesive.
 Cons: Challenging for large projects with complex components.
 Risk: ðŸ’µ Low
 Speed: ðŸ”´ Slow

ðŸ”¹ Solutions Split by Components (e.g., Flows)
 Pros: Easy to find component.
 Cons: Requires strong communication between teams.
 Risk: ðŸ”´ High
 Speed: ðŸŸ¡ Medium to Slow

DISCLAIMER: Every approach above will require communication across your developers and teams. Even the most "pro code" solution can't get around that. 

Speed is defined by how quickly you can release to production, NOT how long the deployment takes. e.g. If your departments manage their own solutions and their tables don't impact another team, not having to deploy 1 giant solution that another team is working on, is faster.

The gold standard is to keep everything in 1 solution if your team has the DevOps talent for it. 

Keep in mind splitting may be inevitable in the case of the Zip being too large or anomalies like Custom Connectors.
